## Bill of Materials (per pack — 1 day's ration)

| Component | Qty | Unit | Unit Cost (gp) | Ext. Cost (gp) |
| --- | ---:| --- | ---:| ---:|
| Wheat flour | 5 | lb | 0.02 | 0.10 |
| Salt | 0.05 | lb | 0.20 | 0.01 |
| Cooking oil (optional) | 0.02 | lb | 0.50 | 0.01 |
| Fuel (firewood/cooking) | 0.1 | bundle | 0.20 | 0.02 |
| Packaging (cloth/wax) | 1 | pack | 0.01 | 0.01 |
| Water | — | — | — | 0.00 |
| **Materials subtotal** | | | | **0.15 gp** |

## Production Steps & Time

1. Mix flour, salt, and water into a stiff dough (~10 minutes).
2. Roll and cut into flat biscuits (~10 minutes).
3. Bake or dry over low heat until thoroughly dry (~60–90 minutes, low attention).
4. Cool and pack into cloth or waxed wrapping (~5 minutes).

Typical hands-on labor time: ~25 minutes per pack (baking time is passive). Estimated labor cost assumes a skilled baker rate of 2 gp/day; 1 day = 8 hours = 480 minutes, so 25 minutes ≈ 0.052 days → labor per pack = 2 gp * 0.052 ≈ 0.10 gp.

## Cost Rollup (per pack)

- **Materials:** 0.15 gp (1.5 sp)
- **Labor:** 0.10 gp (1.0 sp)
- **Overhead & utilities (10% of materials+labor):** 0.025 gp (0.25 sp)

- **Total manufacturing cost:** 0.275 gp (2.75 sp)

## Unit Costing & Pricing

- **Cost per pack (rounded):** 0.28 gp (≈2.8 sp)
- **Suggested wholesale margin (25%):** 0.07 gp → wholesale price ≈ 0.35 gp (3.5 sp)
- **Suggested retail price (rounded):** 0.50 gp (5 sp) — matches typical market price for a day's ration in many regions.

## Price Modifiers by Location

Prices vary by local demand, transport cost, and scarcity. Use the multipliers below to adjust retail price from the baseline retail price (0.50 gp).

| Location Type | Multiplier | Example Retail Price (from 0.50 gp) |
| --- | ---:| ---:|
| Major City / Port | 1.00 | 0.50 gp |
| Town | 1.10 | 0.55 gp |
| Village | 1.20 | 0.60 gp |
| Frontier / Outpost | 1.50 | 0.75 gp |
| Ship / Caravan Provisioner (resupply) | 1.30 | 0.65 gp |

Notes:

- During regional shortages or high transit risk, increase multipliers by 10–50% depending on severity.
- For bulk sales (wholesale to military/merchant fleets), apply a bulk discount (example: 0.75× retail).

## Price Modifiers by Production Scale

Production scale affects unit cost and recommended pricing. Apply the following multipliers to the manufacturing cost or expected wholesale price to estimate final pricing dynamics.

| Production Scale | Unit Cost Multiplier vs. Artisanal | Example Unit Cost (from 0.28 gp) |
| --- | ---:| ---:|
| Cottage / Home Baking | 1.50 | 0.42 gp |
| Local Bakery (Artisanal) | 1.00 | 0.28 gp |
| Regional Supplier | 0.80 | 0.22 gp |
| Industrial Producer | 0.55 | 0.15 gp |

Example calculations:

- Cottage price (retail estimate): baseline retail 0.50 gp × cottage premium 1.2 → ~0.60 gp
- Industrial wholesale (per-unit cost): 0.28 gp × 0.55 ≈ 0.15 gp, allowing lower wholesale/retail pricing in high-volume contracts.


## Notes

- Quantities and costs are estimates for a small-scale bakery in a low-cost region; prices vary by city, season, and supply.
- For large-scale production, expect material discounts and lower labor per unit (economies of scale), which will reduce unit cost considerably.

## Availability

Availability varies by settlement type and region. The table below summarizes typical availability, lead time, and common pack sizes.

| Location Type | Typical Availability | Lead Time | Common Pack Size |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Major City / Port | High — widely stocked in markets and provisioners | Immediate (in-store) | Single pack (1 day), Bulk (10/20 packs) |
| Town | High — sold by general stores and bakeries | Immediate to same day | Single pack, 5-pack bundles |
| Village | Moderate — available from local bakeries or traveling merchants | Same day to 1–3 days | Single pack, small bundles |
| Frontier / Outpost | Low — available sporadically, often from supply caravans | Days to weeks (resupply dependent) | Single pack (often bulk pre-ordered) |
| Ship / Caravan Provisioner | High while in port or at resupply stops; rationed during voyage | Immediate at provisioning; otherwise none | Bulk barrels or waxed bundles (20+ packs)

Notes:

- Regional shortages (war, famine, or poor harvests) increase lead time and price.
- Preservation means Hardtack is commonly stocked by military, naval, and merchant provisioning services.

## Industrial Production Levels

Different production scales affect unit cost, lead time, and packaging.

- Cottage / Home Baking
	- Scale: Very small (family-level)
	- Unit cost: High (no bulk discount), manual labor-intensive
	- Lead time: Short for small batches
	- Typical buyer: Local household, traveler

- Local Bakery (Artisanal)
	- Scale: Small business
	- Unit cost: Moderate, some bulk purchasing for ingredients
	- Lead time: Same day to next day; small batch customization possible
	- Packaging: Cloth or waxed paper bundles

- Regional Supplier (Commercial)
	- Scale: Multi-bakery or centralized production serving a region
	- Unit cost: Lower due to bulk ingredient purchase and shared ovens
	- Lead time: 1–3 days; consistent supply to towns
	- Packaging: Tins, waxed crates, standardized packs

- Industrial Producer (Mass Production)
	- Scale: Large ovens, mechanized processing, bulk logistics
	- Unit cost: Lowest (economies of scale), minimal manual labor cost per unit
	- Lead time: Continuous supply; suitable for provisioning fleets and armies
	- Packaging: Bulk barrels, sealed tins, palletized crates

## Industrial Impact on Cost Rollup

- Expect materials discount of 10–40% at regional/industrial scale depending on volume.
- Labor per unit drops substantially at larger scales; automation can reduce labor by 70%+ compared to artisanal methods.
- Overhead allocation changes: packaging and logistics become significant cost drivers at industrial scale.

Example (scaled estimate, per pack at industrial scale):

- Materials: 0.10 gp
- Labor: 0.03 gp
- Overhead & logistics: 0.02 gp
- **Total cost (industrial):** 0.15 gp → allows aggressive wholesale pricing and large-volume contracts.

## Volume & Packaging

- **Unit dimensions (single pack):** ~4 in × 3 in × 1 in (approx. 10 cubic inches)
- **Pack weight:** 2 lb
- **Retail pack:** 1 pack (single-day ration)
- **Box / Case:** 10 packs per box (suggested box dims ~10 in × 7 in × 5 in, box volume ≈ 350 in³ ≈ 0.20 ft³)
- **Palletization (example):** 120 boxes per pallet (1,200 packs); pallet footprint ≈ 4.0 ft × 3.3 ft; pallet height ≈ 3.9 ft; approximate pallet volume ≈ 51 ft³; pallet gross weight ≈ 2,425 lb depending on packaging
- **Packaging variants:** single retail packs, 5-pack bundles, 10-pack retail boxes, bulk barrels (20+ packs)

Notes:

- Document exact packaging dimensions and weights with supplier drawings for logistics planning.
- Use cubic feet (ft³) and weight (lb) for warehouse slotting and freight rate calculations.

## Inventory Management Requirements

These requirements define how HardTack is tracked, stored, replenished, and quality-controlled in inventory systems.

- **Inventory UOM:** pack (base unit = 1 day's ration). Case and pallet are higher-level UOMs.
+ **SKU / Identifier:** Use `CON-RAT-HTK-STD` (Search Name) and `Item Number: CON0001` as primary keys.
- **Lot / Batch Tracking:** Every production run must be assigned a batch number recorded with Production Date, QC Roll result, and Best-Before/Expiry date (Production Date + shelf-life). Batch must be scannable and linked to inbound receipts.
- **Shelf-Life / Expiry Management:** Track `Manufacture Date` and `Expiry Date` per lot; warehouse should support automatic aging alerts (e.g., 30/14/7/1 days to expiry) and auto-pick from earliest-expiring batches (FIFO by expiry).
- **Quality Control (QC):** For each batch, sample according to lot size (example: 1% of packs or minimum 3 packs) and record Quality Roll results. Acceptance criteria: average roll ≥ 3 (Below Average) to accept; rolls of 1 (Very Poor) on any sample → hold/reject batch and quarantine.
- **Reorder Point / Safety Stock:** Reorder Point = (Average Daily Usage × Lead Time) + Safety Stock. Example: Average daily usage = 100 packs, Lead Time = 7 days → base reorder point = 700 packs. Safety Stock = coverage for demand variability (e.g., 7 days × avg daily usage = 700) → set ROP = 1,400 packs for conservative sizing. Tune per-location.
- **Min / Max Stock by Location:** Define location-level Min/Max (example: Central warehouse Min 2,000 / Max 10,000 packs; Town store Min 20 / Max 200 packs).
- **Preferred Cost Flow / Valuation:** Use FIFO for perishable goods; inventory valuation by Standard Cost with periodic variance reconciliation or by Weighted Average if preferred by accounting.
- **Reservation & Allocation:** Support reservations for committed orders (outbound), available = on-hand − reserved − quarantined.
- **Receiving & Putaway:** Require inspection at receipt; assign putaway location based on slotting rules (temperature, humidity, rotation priority). Store on pallets; do not place directly on floors.
- **Storage Conditions & Handling:** Store dry, ambient temperature (recommended 41–77°F), relative humidity < 65%. Keep in sealed packaging; avoid exposure to pests. Maximum safe stacking: 6 pallets high (verify packaging strength). Label pallet with Batch, Qty, Production Date, Expiry.
- **Traceability & Recall:** Maintain lot traceability from production → distribution → retail. Provide a recall procedure: identify affected lots, quarantine locations, notify stakeholders, and process returns or disposal.
- **Barcode / Serialization:** Use scannable codes on boxes and pallets embedding SKU, Batch, Production Date, Expiry, and Quantity (GS1-128 or QR recommended). Ensure receiving/packing scanners map codes to WMS/ERP records.
- **Integration Fields (ERP/WMS):** Inventory Account, Cost Center, Preferred Vendor, Lead Time (days), Avg Daily Usage, Safety Stock, Reorder Point, Shelf-Life (days), Handling Notes.

Suggested reports/metrics:

- On-hand qty by location, Available qty, Reserved qty, Quarantined qty
- Days of Supply = On-hand / Avg Daily Usage
- Aging report by days-to-expiry
- Inventory turnover and shrinkage by period
- Batch QC pass/fail rates

Operational notes:

- Use batch averages from Quality Roll sampling to set wholesale pricing and acceptance thresholds for incoming supplier lots.
- For high-volume producers, integrate IoT pallet scales or weight checks at packing to validate per-pallet quantities and detect shrinkage.

## Quality Roll (randomized quality outcomes)

Use a single d6 roll to determine the produced pack's quality and apply the associated modifiers to shelf-life, taste/quality perception, and price. Roll once per production batch or per pack for detailed simulation.

| Roll (1d6) | Quality Tier | Shelf-Life Modifier | Taste/Quality Modifier | Price Multiplier |
| ---:| --- | ---:| ---:| ---:|
| 1 | Very Poor (Spoiled) | -75% | -75% (inedible) | 0.25 |
| 2 | Poor | -50% | -40% | 0.5 |
| 3 | Below Average | -25% | -15% | 0.8 |
| 4 | Average | 0% | 0% | 1.0 |
| 5 | Good | +25% | +15% | 1.15 |
| 6 | Exceptional | +50% | +35% | 1.40 |

How to apply:

- Start with the baseline shelf-life and price (see `Unit Costing & Pricing`). For a given pack, roll 1d6.
- Apply the Shelf-Life Modifier to the baseline shelf-life (e.g., if baseline is 365 days, a roll of 5 → 365 × 1.25 ≈ 456 days).
- Apply the Price Multiplier to the suggested retail price to get the adjusted market price for that batch/pack.
- For Very Poor results consider removal from inventory (discard) or conversion to low-grade feed; mark as `unsellable` when inedible.

Example:

- Baseline retail: 0.50 gp. Roll = 5 (Good) → price = 0.50 × 1.15 = 0.575 gp (≈5.75 sp).
- Baseline shelf-life: 365 days. Roll = 6 (Exceptional) → shelf-life ≈ 365 × 1.5 = 547 days.

Notes:

- You can increase resolution by using 2d6 or d20 and mapping ranges to the same tiers if you prefer less binary variance.
- For large-scale production, sample a small number of packs from each batch and use the batch average quality to set wholesale pricing.
