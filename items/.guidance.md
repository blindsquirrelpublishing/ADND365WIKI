Purpose
-------

This file documents conventions and best practices for creating and maintaining item markdown files in this `items/` folder.

Key rules
---------

- Use the `.template.md` file as the canonical template for new items. Copy it and replace placeholders.
- Filenames: use TitleCase or snake_case consistent with existing files (e.g., `Shortsword.md`, `Light_Hammer.md`). Do not include spaces or special characters.
- Frontmatter: keep minimal YAML with `title`, `category`, and optional `tags`. Example:

  ---
  title: Shortsword
  category: Weapons
  ---

- Do not include source lines in individual item files. Source metadata is recorded centrally when needed.
- Do not use emojis or inline icons in content — use plain headings and text.

- Include ERP fields in new items when relevant. Use the `ERP Data` section in `.template.md`.
- Item Number: use a unique identifier in the format `ITEM-XXXX` and keep it stable; this field is used for inventory, purchasing, and accounting integrations.

Item numbering standard
----------------------

We use a type-prefixed, zero-padded sequence with NO hyphens. Format: `TTTNNNN`

- `TTT` = 3-letter uppercase type code
- `NNNN` = 4-digit, zero-padded sequence starting at `0001` per type

Examples:

- Weapon: `WPN0001`, `WPN0002`
- Armor: `ARM0001`
- Tool: `TOL0001`
- Consumable: `CON0001`
- Potion: `POT0001`
- Ring: `RNG0001`

Type code mapping (suggested):

- Weapon -> `WPN`
- Armor -> `ARM`
- Tool -> `TOL`
- Consumable -> `CON`
- Potion -> `POT`
- Ring -> `RNG`
- Mount -> `MNT`
- Gear/Adventuring -> `GEA`

Rules:

- Assign sequential numbers per type (don't reuse retired numbers).
- Keep the `Item Number` stable once assigned; use the `Extra Notes` section to record deprecation/archival.
- If you need a new type code, propose and add it to this guidance file.

Search Name convention
----------------------

Use the `Search Name` to provide a compact, searchable product key in the format `XXX-YYY-ZZZ-AAA`.

- `XXX` = Type code (3-letter uppercase) — see Type code mapping above (e.g., `WPN`, `ARM`, `GEA`).
- `YYY` = Subtype code (3-letter uppercase) — short code for subtype (e.g., `RAT` for ration, `SWR` for sword, `BOW` for bow).
- `ZZZ` = Product code (3-letter uppercase) — product identifier (e.g., `HTK` for HardTack, `DGR` for Dagger).
- `AAA` = Variation code (3-letter uppercase) — `STD`, `SPC`, `LGE`, etc.

Examples:

- HardTack: `GEA-RAT-HTK-STD`
- Shortsword (standard): `WPN-SWR-SHS-STD` (example mapping)

Guidance for codes:

- Keep codes short, stable, and documented here. Add new product or subtype codes to this guidance file when created.
- Use `STD` for default/standard variation when no special variation applies.

BOM / Production / Availability guidance
---------------------------------------

- For produced or consumable items, fill the `Bill of Materials`, `Production Steps & Time`, and `Cost Rollup` sections in the template. Provide realistic unit costs and labor assumptions.
- Include `Availability` and `Industrial Production Levels` when the item is commonly produced at scale or provisioned (e.g., food, rations, ammunition).
- Use the `Extra Notes` section to link to supplier contacts, historical pricing, or archival records.

Content guidelines
------------------

- Follow the structure in `.template.md`: Basic Info, Description, Item Effects, Weapon/Armor/Consumable Details, Value & Weight, Extra Notes.
- Where applicable, include a small markdown table for weapon/armor stats (damage, weight, properties).
- Keep descriptions concise (1–4 short paragraphs) and rules-focused.

Adding price/weight data
------------------------

- Use typical tabletop conventions for price (gp) and weight (lb). Example:

  - Typical Price: 10 gp
  - Weight: 2 lb

- For ranges, indicate common range: `5–15 gp`.

Version control & workflow
-------------------------

- Create a feature branch for bulk changes: `items/<task>-<short-desc>`.
- Commit message format: `items: add <ItemName>`, `items: update <ItemName>`.
- Open a PR and request review for large batches or structural changes.

Automation & validation
-----------------------

- Keep the `.template.md` as the authoritative source for new items.
- Consider adding scripts later to validate frontmatter and required sections across `items/*.md`.

Maintenance notes
-----------------

- If an item becomes obsolete or duplicated, move it to an `archive/` folder rather than deleting outright.
- Preserve lore or homebrew markers in `Extra Notes` and use `Tags` to help search/filter.

If you want different conventions (filenames, frontmatter fields, or automated checks), state the desired rules and I will apply them across the `items/` set.
